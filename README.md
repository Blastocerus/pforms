Web based collection of information of examination details at the Faculty of Applied Sciences

The examination regulations of our faculty requiere the board of examininers to confirm the forms of examination of each and every module taught at our faculty. The collection of this information is tedious as every examiner has her own way of structuring her data. This project aims on simplifying this process with an approach based on HTML forms.
